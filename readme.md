# Lab | Tableau Sheets 2

In this lab, you will have to create several plots that you will use later in the business case. 

### Instructions

Please create the following plots:

1. Horizontal bar plot showing **user claims by gender and marital status**. Add labels to each bar displaying the number of claims.   
2. Horizontally stacked bar plot showing **user claims by Educational level and employment status**. Add labels to each bar displaying the number of claims. 
3. Horizontally stacked bar plot showing **claims by policy type with coverage information**. Add labels to each bar displaying the number of claims.  
4. Tree plot to show **user's region, colored by state**. Add labels to each element to show the number of clients. 
5. Horizontally stacked bar plot to show the **number of claims by day of the week**. Each bar must display the type of car and the percentage of claims within the day. Hint: use a quick table calculation to show "Percentage of total".  
6. Line plot of **open complaints and policies** split by year, quarter, month, day (Hint: "Effective to Date" is a date/time field that can be expanded by clicking on the "+" sign when it's on the columns toolbar). Use a dual-axis to display complaints and policies in the same plot, and synchronize both axes.
7. Scatter plot of **Monthly fee vs Months since the last claim**, vertically split and colored by "Vehicle class". Use different markers for each "Vehicle size".
